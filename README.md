# spring-microservices
Learning creation of microservice using spring

For multiple processes working together they need to find each other. Similar to Java RMI. Microservices has the same requirement.

The developers at Netflix had this problem when building their systems and created a registration server called Eureka (“I have found it” in Greek). They made their discovery server open-source and Spring has incorporated into Spring Cloud, making it even easier to run up a Eureka server.
